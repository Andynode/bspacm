This area contains files intended to simplify builds of ARM Cortex-M
applications using the ARM GNU toolchain.

Among features are:

* Shared startup and linker scripts rather than requiring customization
  for each application or device;

* Shared Makefile infrastructure derived from
  [BSP430](http://pabigot.github.io/bsp430/).
